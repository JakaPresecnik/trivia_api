# Trivia API
This project is a showcasing knowledge how to implement api with python. It can also be used as a template on the subject. The app allows people to have trivia using a webpage.

## Getting started
### Pre-requisites
In order to work with the project, you need to have the following installed on your computer:
- Python 3.7
- Postgresql
- Node.js
- Node Package Manager (NPM)

### Setup
The project is split onto two sections:
- [frontend](./frontend/README.md)
- [backend](./backend/README.md)
Go to individual folders and follow each setup.

#### Quick setup for frontend
Open a terminal, cd into frontend folder and run:
```
npm i
npm start
```
#### Quick setup for backend
There might be different variations of your systems so I recommend following the guide in [backend](./backend/README.md) folder!

Open another terminal, cd into backend folder and run:
```
py -3.7 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt
psql trivia < trivia.psql
set FLASK_APP=src/app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development
set DB_USER=postgres
set DB_PASSWORD=postgres
flask run --reload
```
**If you get errors, follow the guide in backend folder!**

## Full Stack Trivia
The application implemended with Front-end does the following:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

There are also other functionalities implemented on the backend. Use *API reference* as guidence.

## API Reference
### Getting started
- Base URL: This app can only be run locally and it is not hosted as a base URL. It is hosted at the default `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in this format:
```
{
      "success": False, 
      "error": 400,
      "message": "Bad request"
}
```
The API can return 5 types of errors when the request fails:
- 400: Bad request
- 404: Not found
- 409: Already exists
- 422: Unprocessable
- 500: Internal Server Error
